# Capstone Project | visionOS Specialist | Roger Navarro
 
This capstone project is designed to showcase your understanding of fundamental spatial computing concepts, iOS development with SwiftUI, the visionOS platform, immersive experience design, Reality Composer Pro, and RealityKit utilization. You will have the option to choose one of two projects that align with your interests and skills.
By completing this project, you will be able to:
Develop visionOS applications using SwiftUI.
Design immersive spatial experiences.
Integrate Reality Composer Pro and RealityKit to your applications.

Please, take into consideration that loading the immersive space may take a few seconds. This is becuase the 3D objects are big.
